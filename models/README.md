Aktive Knowledge Models (AKM) - Dementia Treatment
This repository contains AKM Models for Dementia Treatment. The AKM model is represented in JSON format and can be found f.ex. in the 
AKM-Dementia-treatment__PR.json file.

## What is an AKM Model?
An AKM is a knowledge representation model that captures knowledge in a structured and machine-readable format. It is designed to support reasoning and decision-making in complex domains.

The AKM Model contains the following nodes:

* Age: The age of the patient.
* Gender: The gender of the patient.
* Severity: The severity of the dementia.
* Comorbidity: The presence of comorbidities (Other conditions).
* Treatment: The type of treatment.
* Response: The response to treatment.

The AKM captures dependencies between these variables, which can be used to reason about the effectiveness of different treatments for patients with dementia.

# How to use the AKM
The AKM can be used to support decision-making in the treatment of dementia. Given a patient's age, gender, severity of dementia, and comorbidities, the AKM can be used to predict the effectiveness of different treatments and the likelihood of a positive response to treatment.

# Conclusion
The AKM-Dementia-treatment model file contains an AKM for Dementia Treatment. It is a model that captures the relationships between various factors that affect the treatment of dementia. The AKM can be used to support decision-making in the treatment of dementia and can be loaded into a probabilistic programming framework for inference and prediction.
