## Introduction

The Modelling process is based on the following steps:

<details>
<summary>Design Thinking</summary>
  
The Design Thinking process is a user-centric approach to problem-solving that typically involves five phases. It's widely used in various fields, including software development, product design, and business innovation. Here's an overview of each phase:

Empathize: This initial stage involves understanding the users' needs, experiences, and motivations. It often includes observing and engaging with users to gain insights into their behaviors and attitudes. This phase is crucial for establishing empathy with the users, which is a key aspect of Design Thinking.

Define: In this phase, the insights gathered during the Empathize stage are synthesized into a clear problem statement. This is where you define the core problem you are trying to solve, often in the form of a user-centered problem statement. It sets a clear direction for the project.

Ideate: Once the problem is defined, the Ideate phase involves generating a wide range of creative ideas to address the problem. This is often done through brainstorming sessions and other ideation techniques. The goal is to explore a broad solution space and think outside the box.

Prototype: The ideas generated during the Ideate phase are turned into tangible prototypes. These prototypes can range from simple paper models to more sophisticated digital or physical creations. The purpose of this phase is to create a physical or digital representation of the solutions to explore their potential.

Test: In the final phase, the prototypes are tested with real users. This involves observing how users interact with the prototype and gathering feedback. The testing phase is crucial for understanding the viability of the proposed solutions and for making iterative improvements based on user feedback.

Throughout the Design Thinking process, iteration is key. Based on feedback and insights gained, teams often cycle back to earlier stages to refine their understanding of the problem or to explore new solution ideas. This iterative approach ensures that the final solution is deeply aligned with user needs and has gone through rigorous refinement and testing.

## Lets get started

(Tips: You can duplicate this browser-tab and move it on the side, to have it available when doing the procedure)

Open AKM Modeller:  

<https://akmmclient-main.vercel.app/modelling> the most tested version, but may lack some features

<https://akmclient-beta.herokuapp.com/modelling> more tested version without latest features

<https://akmclient-alfa.herokuapp.com/modelling> bleeding edge version with latest featuress not well tested

(You can switch version by clicking on the dropdown menu "V." in the main menu of AKM Modeller)

## To start a new model project

<details>

Click on the GitHub button in the top menu to open the GitHub download dialog.

Fill in the dialog:

RepoOwner: "Kavca"
Repository: "kavca-akm-models"
Path: "startmodels"

Clik the "LIST MODELS" button to list the models in the repository.
Select one of the start models and click "DONE"

To rename the project, model and modelview, select the "_ADMIN_MODEL in the model dropdown menu.

- Change the name of the project object to your project name.
- Change the name of the Model object to your model name.
- Change the name of the Modelview object to your modelview name, i.e. "01-Main".

Right click the background and select "Update Project from AdminModel.

Click refresh (Blue text in the top right corner)

Now you can start modeling.

***(In AKM Modeller)***

Select "Modelling" in the top menu.

## Open and save local files

### 1. Open a Project.json file in AKM Modeller

<details><summary markdown="span">Open local project files: <code> Click: "Choose file" button</code></summary>

Click on: Project files: "Choose file" button and select the project file you want to load (.json file).

![alt text](./img/ChooseFile.png)

The selected file will be loaded in the AKM Modeller.

</details>

---

### 2. Then Work with your model project

See the documentation how to used AKM Modeller in "Help" in top menu.

---

### 3. Save your model project to Local Project.json file

<details><summary markdown="span">To save local project files: <code> Click on: "Save" button</code></summary>

To save the current project.json file Click on the "Save" button.

The file will by default be saved in Download folder as a "Projectname".json file.

</details>

## Open and save models on GitHub repository

To open a model stored on GitHub repository:

<details><summary markdown="span">Open GitHub repository AKM project files in AKM Modeller: <code> Click on: "GitHub" button</code></summary>
..

Click on "GitHub" button to open the dialog for GitHub repository and fill in the required fields.

- Repository URL:  <https://api.github.com/users/UserName/repos/>

then click on: "LIST MODELS" button and then select a model in the "Select Model" dropdown list.

(The list is from the **main** branch of the repository.)

The model will be loaded in AKM Modeller.

Click on "X" button in the top right corner to close the GitHub repository select dialog.

To upload a model to GitHub repository:

First make sure you have saved your Project.json file locally (the model you want to upload), as described in item 3 above.
